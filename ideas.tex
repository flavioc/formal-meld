\subsection{Data vs Control}

\begin{itemize}
   \item Discover facts that work like node fields and actually never go away (only their arguments change).
   \item Discover facts that drive the computation (usually are consumed and then go away).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{JIT Compilation}

Compile most used rules to assembly.

\subsection{Improve indexing}

Do just in time indexing by gathering statistics about indexing.

\subsection{Improve rule engine}

Indexing of the current set of facts needs to be vastly improved.

\subsection{Find consuming chain of linear facts}

Sometimes a linear fact $a$ derives a $b$ that derives a $c$, etc. Once $a$ is derived we know that a set of rules will be run in sequence. We need to prove that this will happen no matter what.

\subsection{Improved fact loading}

Allow compilation of facts to a separate file. Also, load facts faster.
